# Backend Coding Challenge

Overview

The goal of the project is to implement two endpoints, which are:

    An endpoint that takes a long URL as input and returns a shortened version of that URL.
    An endpoint that can be accessed through the shortened URL and redirects the user to the original long URL.

Requirements

    The shortened URL should be a unique key that can be used to retrieve the original long URL.
    The shortened URL should be accessible through a web browser.
    The shortened URL should redirect the user to the original long URL.

System Requirements

    A functional installation of the .NET Core 7.0 SDK
    A code editor you're comfortable with.

Getting Started

    Clone the project repository
    Run the application with your IDE of choice or by running dotnet run --project ./src/Api/Api.csproj in the project root directory in a terminal.
    Implement the required endpoints. Basic scaffolding for them already exists in the <project_root>/src/Api/Endpoints/Url directory.
    Test your implementation using a web browser or a tool like curl

# Hints for MS SQL Server Manager
- the database is generated manually with MS SQL Server Manager, check out the dump in ./dumps
- Install SQL Express 2019
- Modify Database Access for mixed authentification
- Install MSSQL Server Manager 2019 (hint: you cant create tables in older or backend versions!)
- Create database
- Create a SQL User in MSSQL Server Manager and grant access to database
- if needed restart MSSQL Express service
- Settings in MSSQL to modify tables: Optionen->Designer-Speichern von Ã„nderungen verhindern
- ConnectionString: Data Source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=testDatabase;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=user;Password=*****
- Powershell-Script for testing ConnectionString is present: .\powershell\testDBConnect.ps1
